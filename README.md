1. Created the Rail API endpoints to keep it simple and easy to integerate with the web applications as well as mobil application
2. Handled differnet user types and their roles accross the application i.e., Admin, Managers, Business Developers & Engineers
3. Core principles of React is used for the frontend development. ContextAPI and reducers are used for smooth state
4. management of the components accross the application

The project is very simple and easy to use. Just simply clone the API as well as the front-end of the project, run the rails api on localhost:3000 and cloned front-end on localhost:3001.
If everything is properly setup then, it is very easy to use. However, in case of any confusion and difficulty, feel free to contact me at my email baigahmad323@gmail.com
